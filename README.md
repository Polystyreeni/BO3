# BO3
Most of the gsc/csc scripts I have made for Call of Duty Black Ops 3, which featured in the map "Project Elemental". This does not include everything, since some scripts were modified versions of scripts from other creators that have since been removed. An example would be the BO2 perks.

I did not edit any of these files before uploading, so they will most likely be lacking in terms of commenting and polish. The map was started many years ago when I had next to no coding experience, which you can most likely see from some of these scripts :)

Do as you wish with these: use in your maps/mods, cram these in a box map, steal and claim as your own, laugh at them, whatever.
Happy modding!
